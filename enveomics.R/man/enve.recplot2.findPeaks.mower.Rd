\title{enve recplot2 findPeaks mower}
\description{Identifies peaks in the population histogram potentially indicating
sub-population mixtures, using a custom distribution-mowing method.}
\usage{enve.recplot2.findPeaks.mower(x, min.points = 10, quant.est = c(0.002, 
    0.998), mlv.opts = list(method = "parzen"), fitdist.opts.sn = list(distr = "sn", 
    method = "qme", probs = c(0.1, 0.5, 0.8), start = list(omega = 1, 
        alpha = -1), lower = c(0, -Inf, -Inf)), fitdist.opts.norm = list(distr = "norm", 
    method = "qme", probs = c(0.4, 0.6), start = list(sd = 1), 
    lower = c(0, -Inf)), rm.top = 0.05, with.skewness = TRUE, 
    optim.rounds = 200, optim.epsilon = 1e-04, merge.logdist = log(1.75), 
    verbose = FALSE, log = TRUE)}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{An `enve.RecPlot2` object.}
  \item{min.points}{Minimum number of points in the quantile-estimation-range
(`quant.est`) to estimate a peak.}
  \item{quant.est}{Range of quantiles to be used in the estimation of a peak's
parameters.}
  \item{mlv.opts}{Ignored. For backwards compatibility.}
  \item{fitdist.opts.sn}{
}
  \item{fitdist.opts.norm}{
}
  \item{rm.top}{Top-values to remove before finding peaks, as a quantile probability.
This step is useful to remove highly conserved regions, but can be
turned off by setting rm.top=0. The quantile is determined *after*
removing zero-coverage windows.}
  \item{with.skewness}{Allow skewness correction of the peaks. Typically, the
sequencing-depth distribution for a single peak is left-skewed, due
partly (but not exclusively) to fragmentation and mapping sensitivity.
See Lindner et al 2013, Bioinformatics 29(10):1260-7 for an
alternative solution for the first problem (fragmentation) called
"tail distribution".}
  \item{optim.rounds}{Maximum rounds of peak optimization.}
  \item{optim.epsilon}{Trace change at which optimization stops (unless `optim.rounds` is
reached first). The trace change is estimated as the sum of square
differences between parameters in one round and those from two rounds
earlier (to avoid infinite loops from approximation).}
  \item{merge.logdist}{Maximum value of |log-ratio| between centrality parameters in peaks to
attempt merging. The default of ~0.22 corresponds to a maximum
difference of 25\%.}
  \item{verbose}{Display (mostly debugging) information.}
  \item{log}{Logical value indicating if the estimations should be performed in
natural logarithm units. Do not change unless you know what you're
doing.}
}

\value{Returns a list of `enve.RecPlot2.Peak` objects.}
